###What is research?
research is a cycle of homeworks that is dedicated to working with big data.

###So what is it doing?
This is chat-bot for Telegram (and, maybe, for Google Hangouts) that will help user to lessen the time used for creating events in Google Calendar and for showing places? where evnts are held. In our times it is hard to keep track of all events and to remember where they are held, so this bot is created to help people manage their time.

###Entering data
When user is entering he gives us his Google Calendar ID (his email address) and in tha end he gets a list of events that are in his calendar, depending on how many of them he wants

###Modules
We have three modules. One with Calendar ADT which is working with Calendar API and events in Calendar. Second one with Geolocation ADT which is working with Google Maps API. Third module is combining all work together and makes everything work.
